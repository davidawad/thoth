# Thoth

### Seek truth, but faster.

Thoth is a speed reading tool that enables you to read PDF's and text selections faster than you otherwise would.
It contains a bevy of settings and features for customizing your experience.

See my presentation here for a walkthrough : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLc0WiCYn4

Thoth is hosted online @ https://thoth-david-awad.vercel.app/

This project is a proof of concept implementing Thoth as described in [this research paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01699)
